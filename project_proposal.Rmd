# The tentative project title
The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Air Quality in Chinese Cities

# The motivation for this project
In order to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, China entered lockdown in early February 2020, minimizing all industrial, transportation, and commercial activities. Although the lockdown caused tremendous loss to the economy, previous research has shown the air condition in the top four megacities of China improved significantly during the lockdown period, due to a dramatic decrease in automobile and industrial emissions. Our motivation is to find out whether “lockdown improves air quality" is a common phenomenon in Chinese cities including but not only limited to megacities. We are also interested in how the geographical location, population, and GDP of each city affect the degree of air quality improvement, and which pollutant’s daily air quality index(AQI) was affected the most. AQI is a variable describing the daily level of air pollution from pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2. Each pollutant has its own AQI value for each day.
